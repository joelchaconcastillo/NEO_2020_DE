Differential Evolution (\DE{}) is a popular population-based meta-heuristic that has been successfully used in complex 
optimization problems.
%
Premature convergence is one of the most important drawbacks that affects its performance.
%
In this paper, a novel replacement strategy that combines the use of an elite population and a mechanism to preserve 
diversity explicitly is devised.
%
The proposal is integrated with \DE{} to generate the \DE{} with Enhanced Diversity Maintenance (\DEEDM{}).
%
The main novelty is the use of a dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation to adapt the optimizer to the 
requirements of the different optimization stages.
%
Experimental validation is carried out with several benchmark tests proposed in competitions of the well-known IEEE Congress on 
Evolutionary Computation.
%
Top-rank algorithms of each competition, as well as other diversity-based schemes, 
are used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposal.
%
The new method avoids premature convergence and significantly improves further the results obtained by state-of-the-art algorithms.
